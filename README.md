# Hello-World
First Repository, my baby steps to learning Git.
I am Shreya Saxena, hailing from Jaipur, India. This is my first attempt at learning something that is completelty out of my confort zone but I am elated! 
Did I mention that I continued to make great progress in GitHub? I participated in Hacktoberfest and even won a free t-shirt! Now that's how you roll!
Let's Go!
